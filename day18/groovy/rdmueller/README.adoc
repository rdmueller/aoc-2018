This solution is written in Groovy.

It is the 24th of december and I have to catch up with those challenges.
Let's hope this is solveable within 30 minutes...

=== First Star

Let's first read the file into a map

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=readInput]
....

now calculate the next state for one cell

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=nextCell]
....

and the whole next state

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=nextState]
....

and calculate the checksum

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=caclChecksum]
....


=== Second Star

I've extended the functions from part one with the size parameter and had to write a new iteration:

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=dynamicLargest]
....
