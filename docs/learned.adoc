a| * Documentation driven development: first write the docs, then do the coding.
Works great on top of test driven development!
* Python has no power-assertions like groovy has. Makes testing harder ðŸ˜’
* VS Code and thus gitlab has a column mode for editing!
* All your tests might run fine but the solution is still wrong

a| * The zip operator in Kotlin combines two Lists into a List<Pair>>
