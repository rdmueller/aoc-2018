|{rdmueller}
a| * Elm is a language which seems to compile / transpile to JavaScript

|{robertwalter83}

|{gysel}
a| * How to create an infinite, repeating Sequence in Kotlin.

a| * Documentation driven development: first write the docs, then do the coding.
Works great on top of test driven development!
* Python has no power-assertions like groovy has. Makes testing harder 😒
* VS Code and thus gitlab has a column mode for editing!
* All your tests might run fine but the solution is still wrong

|{gysel}
a| * The zip operator in Kotlin combines two Lists into a List<Pair>>
* It makes sense to return either List or Sequence from your functions depending on the result size (List or Stream in Java)
