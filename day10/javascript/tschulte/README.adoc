== First Star

I must confess, that I had no clue at first how to solve this puzzle.
Only after having a peek at the aol slack for this day I got the tip to find the morphed lights with the minimum height or width.

This time I wanted to have the classes immutable to prevent the problems of the previous days where the objects could not be re-used.

The first class is `Light`, which has members for the position and the velocity and a method `move` to create a new `Light` at the position after one second.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=Light]
....

And the `parseLine` method creates a new `Light`.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=parseLine]
....

When all initial `Light` objects are created, a `Lights` object is created with all lights.
The `Lights` object has a `moveUntilMessageAppears` method to find the message and a `toString` method to print the message.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=Lights]
....

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=part1]
....

== Second Star

Luckily this was easy given that part 1 already created a new `Lights` object for each second passed.
All that had to be done was to keep track of the time.
The code above for part 1 already contains that member `time`, but if you check the git history, you will see that this was added to solve this part.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=part2]
....
