== First Star

This is the first time, I used a class in JavaScript to solve the puzzle.
The `parseLine` function reduces the line array to get an array of Steps.
A Step is an object with id and multiple parents and multiple children of type Step.
This array of Steps is sorted by id.

When the steps are parsed, the step order is evaluated by repeatedly find the first step that can be executed.
Since the steps array is sorted by id, the first found step is always the alphabetically first to execute.
