I refactored the code to keep a reference to the first and last pot instead of only the pot "0".
After each increase of the generation it is ensured that there is only exactly one empty pot on both ends.

I printed the state of the pots for the first xhundred generations and noticed that the string stopped changing after some time.
Only the index of the first non-empty pot was changing from now on, resulting in the diff between generations to become constant.

After introducing a new `warmup` method to find the generation after wich the diff becomes constant, the solution got easy.
