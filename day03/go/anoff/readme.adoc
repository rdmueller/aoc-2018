== Part 1

For the first part of the puzzle an input is given with each line representing an area that is being claimed on a map. The goal is to find areas that have multiple (`>= 2`) claims.

As a claim for an area is given in a string format the first job is to extract the relevant information from each new line. For representing this information I use a custom struct `Area`. The following diagram `how to ref?` shows the main tasks for solving the puzzle.

....
@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:initialize empty //space// map;
:initialize overlap counter;
while (new line available?)
  :parse new line to //Area// struct;
  :popuplate //space// map
  with current //Area//
  using **X_Y** as key;
endwhile
while (loop over all\nkeys in //space//)
  if (value >= 2) then (y)
    :inc overlap counter;
  endif
endwhile
:print result;
end

=== Parsing the input

[source, go]
....
include::./solution.go[tags=StructDef]
....

At first I wanted to use a RegExp to do the parsing but could not find the correct method within the https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/[go regexp package], so I ended up bundling together a bunch of https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Split[strings.Split()] calls.

== Part 2

For part 2 the area claim needs to be found that does not have a single overlap with any other area.
The previously generated _space map_ will be reused to accomplish this goal.

[plantuml, day03-part2, png]
....
@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:use slice of all areas and
//space// map from part1;
while (for each areas)
  :init overlapDetected = false;
  while (each point in area)
    :look up point=key in
    area in //space// map;
    if (point value > 1) then (y)
      :overlapDetected = true;
      :stop loop;
    endif
  endwhile
  if (overlapDetected == false) then (y)
    :print area id as solution;
    end
  endif
endwhile
end
